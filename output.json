["Every time I read a Japanese yuri story I get enormously dissapointed because it seems that in order to be a yuri MC somehow there is in the mind of the Japanese authors the requirement to have the soul of a boy, it seems that otherwise it is not possible to have a yuri MC. Are the Japanese writers really that ignorant and horrible in science that they can't seem to separate the two matters from each other? (To me it always feels as if from the moment the MC... more>> discovers she has the soul of a guy the guy takes over and the girl is no longer attracted to boys and often stops acting like a girl entirely, why? It is not needed and to me it feels incredibly unrealistic, but maybe that is more because 99% of the yuri mc's follow this template and it seems like body chemistry and biology seems to have no influence on the preferences and behavior of the MC at all. I'm so dissapointed that all yuri mc's behave like this, it would be far less problematic if it were only 50% of the yuri novels that have this) \nAs you might have guessed this is another story that seems to falls into this trap. Maybe I will be surprised later on but the way this is going I'm afraid I will be dissapointed yet again. <<less", "I'm enjoying this novel, but it's certainly not without its flaws. I like the characters that have been introduced and find their interactions to be rather amusing, though I don't think the characters always act in ways that make sense given what we know about them and their situations. Readers who dislike many Isekai novels will probably dislike this one for the same reason. Those who are willing to apply the suspension of disbelief may find that like myself, there are charming aspects to this story that can be enjoyed... more>> despite its issues.\nIt's worth noting also that the chapters so far are rather short. 2-3 chapters here may not reach the same length as one chapter of another title. So, despite having read 71 \"chapters\" I feel this is still very early in this series. There were no reviews posted at the time this was written so I wanted to give a first impression. <<less", "it was ok, but honestly that every character the MC meets has some elite trait about them is kinda meh. Its also getting to the point (around up to chapter 90) that you are getting chapters full of nothing but fluff. Sure some people like this, but when you get so many chapters that are super short, minimal plot/character advancement, then get fluff that seems to drag on, it pushes things too much.", "I read this awhile back and only up to the point the original translator dropped it. It was still a pretty good read at that point but there was the strong feeling that it was starting to nosedive.\nFWIW the novel might as well not bothered with the yuri or the gender bender. It just wasn't a very sexual novel, let alone erotic. It might as well have been a shounen, transmigration, harem novel and it very well could be by just changing a few pronouns at the appropriate places. Well... more>> except for the fact the MC does actually manage to cement his/her relationships but otherwise pretty cookie cutter.\nWhile it's not getting points for being the next \"Love Story\", \"Story of O\", or even \"Carnal Knowledge\", It does work as a pretty good progression fantasy. The MCs progress is fun fast paced and interesting. The author manages the \"Shucks I Did That\" moments with a fair bit of skill and mostly was able to keep it interesting.\nBottom line: Not a bad read, just don't expect much in the way of s*x. <<less", "MC is a bit ungrateful.... more>>\n\n\nSpoiler\n\n\n She complains on wanting a happy and peaceful life but when she is born a noble, she complains that she wants a nornal family, so a commoner. When she is given outstabding talents, she complains that she will stand out. She really isn't thinking much, or thinking about consequences if she doesn't have power.\n[collapse]\n\n\n\nI don't get why MC wants to reject power, it's as if she is s*upid. Does she not think of the situation if she doesn't have power? All kind of bad things can happen to her. \nIt's always like this, most MCs are ungrateful to everything they're given. Without hard work, they won't be grateful. \nI'm just done with this s*upid novel. Quite s*upid. \n <<less", "I wouldn't really bother picking this up I hate to say. It starts off pretty typical fantasy, then gets pretty heavily Yuri, but at the point I'm dropping it (the 160s) the series has just lost all my interest.\n... more>>\n\n\nSpoiler\n\n\nThe series just fully embraces powerlevel advancing, cheat power, and battles. Like in the mid 100s it was already doing a lot of programming talk and battles and that was annoying but this is just too much. I'm not even sure who I could recommend this series to. People that like isekai yuri but also have a masters in coding and are battle junkies? \n[collapse]\n\n\n <<less", "Spoiler\n\n\nHer father, and the troops he's leading are stronger than the royal capital. And he is the strongest swordsman\nBut he got beaten by his own daughter, the FMC, who just using magic for the first 'fqing' time. And after that, he send her into the royal capital's magic academy because he thought that her talent would be wasted if she didn't go there and train at home...\nWtf!?\n[collapse]", "The novel itself is not bad. But it is lacking in depth. In the beginning, it was ok. But later it got very absurd. Initial chapters made it more like a lesbian version of \"I said make my abilities average\". But that novel had a really good story building. But in this novel, it is lacking.\nBut it is an easy read and the chapters are short.\nNote: after chapter 161, it is MTL. So I dropped it.", "The story somewhat started out decent but it just fell flat to the point it is boring when the author tries to pull out Deus ex with Code skill which technically a hack or overpowered stuff. The problem is that it got powercreeped way too fast and I have seen another writers done a better job than this. After a while author will trying to explain this stat and fighting scene which is badly described which is boring as you probably will skip text due most of it being unreadable... more>> or unnecessary.\nCharacter relationship is great but felt 1 dimensional after the first the early arc. I felt like the author themselves aren't so sure with the character and the development they'll take. So after this early arc everything felt so cheap that it makes a side character from SAO a masterpiece.\nThe world building is kind of weird but it doesn't really depth itself neither it care about the foreshadowing the author write on early story. All it explain was in a world of fantasy where a female ratio were higher than male and female can make children other female. Horaay for Yuri, I guess?\nFinally to put in word the cheat code thing is beyond bad for people who are interested reading this WN, so it could serve as a warning. How it get 3 is beyond me but it has good points if you look it on different perspective but undeniable it won't be as memorable. <<less", "I personally enjoy Yuri novels alot, so the low score is based on simply because it's so boring and generic.\nMC is op and broken so there's zero suspense, there are no stakes. No character development, they like and fall in love with MC For no apparent reason. MC is socially awkward, and even though he originally was a young adult, he really acts like a little kid. The whole gender bender element is done poorly and imo unnecessary.\nStory wise MC got transfered to a fantasy world and changed to a... more>> 10year old girl by a god, who created this world for fun and wants MC to live in it. Then MC proceeds to go to an academy to hone her abilities, meets other girls to join a guild, do quest, etc.. Note that MC didn't die and simply got transfered to the world. I'm sure there some twist and turns later in the story, but I don't expect anything thrilling based on the 100chapters I have read.\nEverything is written so bland, it's the same mumbo jumbo you saw in x Isekai stories before, minus the Yuri stuff.\nI have no quarrels with the Translation though, it's not perfect but good enough to make sense of everything. <<less", "I'm not really sure how I feel about this novel. It's really info heavy in certain chapters to the point where I skipped some and still felt like there was a lot. Some chapters are really short some are really long some dont make any sense and the MC also doesnt make any sense with the way they do things/make decisions. I really wanted to read a legitimate yuri story with some decent romance but this has none if barely any romance and the most they've done as of chapter... more>> 132 is hug. I wouldnt really reccomend this novel if you actually want romance. <<less", "First time writing a review, I guess it's a good read if you are bored, yuri scenes are good too, the characters development is nice, but my problem is I guess the MC is too op. \n\n\nSpoiler\n\n\nPlus, the ending is kinda s*upid, the author showed the goddess of end on chapter 319, MC feel threatened because of the goddess power and also she is stronger than the MC, after that, the MC just go married with her harem and the end????
